Prerequisites
=============
- The EZSDK for the platform is installed on the Linux host. The latest EZSDK for the platform can be downloaded from ????
- EZSDK components are built from top label Makefile using 'make all' command.

BUILDING
========

1) Run this command on host machine to fix libz.la file provided with EZSDK
% sed -i 's/installed=no/installed=yes/' ${DVSDK}/linux-devkit/arm-none-linux-gnueabi/usr/lib/libz.la

2) Change to the top level "gstreamer_ti" directory, and open the file named "Makefile.common" in your favorite editor (vi, emacs, etc.).
   Set the following variables at the top of the file:

    DVSDK_INSTALL_DIR:  Location of your EZSDK installation directory
    TARGET_ROOT_DIR:    Location of the target filesystem's root directory
                        on the Linux host machine.
    CROSS_COMPILER:     Cross compiler being used.  A default is chosen based
                        on the platform you are building for, but you can set
                        it explicitly to one of these values:
                            CS_2009Q1:  CodeSourcery v2009q1
    PLATFORM:           Set the platform variable (**)

** For DM816x/DM814x set PLATFORM=dm816x 

3) Execute this command from the top-level "gstreamer_ti" directory:
% make all install VERBOSE=true

If you want less output during the build, you can omit the "VERBOSE=true"
above.

By default, the GStreamer binaries will be installed to "/opt/gstreamer" on
the target, and some demonstration scripts will be installed to
"/opt/gstreamer_demo".

RUNNING
=======

Run the following commands on target board to export gstreamer environment variables:

#export GST_REGISTRY=/tmp/gst_registry.bin
#export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/gstreamer/lib
#export GST_PLUGIN_PATH=/opt/gstreamer/lib/gstreamer-0.10
#export PATH=/opt/gstreamer/bin:$PATH


After this, run your favorite gstreamer pipeline examples
