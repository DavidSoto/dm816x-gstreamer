Fixed Issues

Known Issues
------------

Release 1.00:
	- Video encode is not supported on DM6467.  DM6467 requires DMAI
	  version at least 1.20.00.06 which is meant to be used with 
	  DVSDK 2.00.  Official support for video encoding on DM6467
	  will be added when DVSDK 2.00 is released.  For customer that
	  already have DVSDK 2.00 you can upgrade the DMAI version in
	  order to use the video encoder.
	- If you don't have "gperf" installed on your system, it may manifest 
	  as a mysterious run issue with libid3tag involving unresolved 
	  symbols.  The gperf package that comes with RHEL 4.6 is sufficient, 
	  but you need to make sure it is installed.
	- The JPEG image elements support multiple color spaces.  However, 
	  not every codec supports every color space.  If you specify a 
	  color space that is not supported you will get an error message 
	  indicating that the plugin failed to create the codec.  Check 
	  the codec user's guide to determine if your codec supports the 
	  color spaces used for the input and output.
	- If clip size is smaller and dmaivideosink element reports 
	  "assertion" then try disabling hw accelerated framecopy. This can 
	  be disabled with -c option in scripts. Note: disabling hw accel 
	  framecopy will affect performance.
