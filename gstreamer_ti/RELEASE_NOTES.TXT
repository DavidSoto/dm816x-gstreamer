Known Issues
------------

Release 1.01:
  - Tighter memory constraints in OMAP35x may cause OOM killers in
    some cases.  See the README.TXT for information on modifying
    bootarg settings to make more memory available to the system.
  - If you don't have "gperf" installed on your system, it may manifest
    as a mysterious run issue with libid3tag involving unresolved
    symbols (something like "undefined symbol: id3_frametype_unknown").
    The gperf package that comes with RHEL 4.6 is sufficient, but you need
    to make sure it is installed.
  - The JPEG image elements support multiple color spaces.  However,
    not every codec supports every color space.  If you specify a
    color space that is not supported you will get an error message
    indicating that the plugin failed to create the codec.  Check
    the codec user's guide to determine if your codec supports the
    color spaces used for the input and output.
  - If clip size is smaller and TIDmaiVideoSink element reports
    "assertion" then try disabling hardware-accelerated frame-copies. This
    can be disabled by specifying accelFrameCopy=FALSE for TIDmaiVideoSink.
    Note: disabling hardware-accelerated frame-copies will affect 
    performance.
  - Tracker 972 - AVI video playback crash in VGA video standard. 
    When playing an AVI file with VGA video standard, it plays ok 
    the first time it runs, the second time it crashes.
  - The plugin will not build on DM357 unless you upgrade the version of
    DMAI in DVSDK 2.05 to DMAI 1.20.00.06.  More information is available
    in the README.TXT.


Trackers unresolved for release 1.01 scheduled for next release

  - Tracker 970 - dmai-perf inaccuracy in fps and bps calculation.
  - Tracker 966 - Update open-source base components.
  - Tracker 903 - DMAI video encoder support refactor.
  - Tracker 867 - Improve video encoders timestamp handling.
  - Tracker 532 - Buffers used during for decoding uses fixed sizes buffers.
  - Tracker 881 - Changing the video Output to use from LCD to DVI crashes
                  the system.


Trackers for defects in other non-plugin software components

  - Tracker 965 - Building gst-plugins-good-0.10.15 with X11 development
                  headers installed on host machine fails.
  - Tracker 968 - 1: command not found when building DM357 DVSDK.
  - Tracker 930 - gstticodecplugin should fail to initialize if
                  CERuntime_init() fails.

Release 1.00
============


New Features
------------
  - Added support for video encoding elements TIVidenc and TIVidenc1.
    These elements support the DM355, DM6446, DM357, DM367 and
    OMAP35x devices.
  - Patches for v4l2src element in the GST good plugin collection
  - Patch 503 Support decodebin and playbin


Fixed Issues
------------
  - Patch 499 Fix memory leak during Fifo flush
  - Patch 506 Fix data type mismatch int / bool for resizer and 
    autoselect properties in TIDmaiVideoSink
  - Bug 303 Playback of audio and video increments VmallocUsed
  - Bug 389 Memory leak in gsttividdec.c and gsttiauddec.c 
    (and probably others)
  - Bug 707 Decode of mp4 file plays back with skips


Known Issues
------------
  - Video encode is not supported on DM6467.  DM6467 requires DMAI
    version at least 1.20.00.06 which is meant to be used with 
    DVSDK 2.00.  Official support for video encoding on DM6467
    will be added when DVSDK 2.00 is released.  For customer that
    already have DVSDK 2.00 you can upgrade the DMAI version in
    order to use the video encoder.
  - If you don't have "gperf" installed on your system, it may manifest 
    as a mysterious run issue with libid3tag involving unresolved 
    symbols.  The gperf package that comes with RHEL 4.6 is sufficient, 
    but you need to make sure it is installed.
  - The JPEG image elements support multiple color spaces.  However, 
    not every codec supports every color space.  If you specify a 
    color space that is not supported you will get an error message 
    indicating that the plugin failed to create the codec.  Check 
    the codec user's guide to determine if your codec supports the 
    color spaces used for the input and output.
  - If clip size is smaller and dmaivideosink element reports 
    "assertion" then try disabling hw accelerated framecopy. This can 
    be disabled with -c option in scripts. Note: disabling hw accel 
    framecopy will affect performance.
  - H264 encoded video from TIVidenc works with VLC if it has a 
    file extension of .264.  In the 1.00.00 release, it was 
    incorrectly stated there was a problem playing H264 files 
    with VLC.
